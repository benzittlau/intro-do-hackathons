          <p>The first step to being successful is understanding what success would be for you</p>
          <div class="learn">
            <p>Hackathons give you:</p>
            <p>Focused time to zone in on something new.</p>
            <p>Great energy to fuel you forward.</p>
            <p>Other resoureces to help you learn.</p>

            <h1>Alignment</h1>
            <div class="learn_and_compete">
              <p class="good">If everyone is truly aligned towards the same goal there can be incredible results.</p>
              <p class="bad">Sometimes people won't be honest with themselves and others, and try and fake alignment.  You're better off working separately if you're truly not aligned!  That's okay!</p>

              <p class="good">Learning with others can be incredibly helpful</p>

            <h1>Libraries</h1>
            <p>Many languages have large ecosystems of libraries which you can leverage in your projects.</p>
            <div class="learn">
              <p class="good">Using libraries can save you from spending time on things you're not learning.</p>
              <p class="bad">Sometimes doing boring things the hard way is the best way to learn.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="compete">
              <p class="good">Libraries are critical to help you get an impressive result in a short time.</p>
              <p class="bad">You should practice with the libraries you plan on using in advance, or could get slowed down with trivial issues.</p>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Version Control</h1>
            <p> Tools for managing and merging your code, such as Git and GitHub, Hg and BitBucket.</p>
            <div class="learn_and_compete">
              <p class="bad">These tools are often complicated and will slow down your initial speed, spending time learning tools instead of coding.</p>
              <p class="good">The benefits that version control brings to collaborating in a common code base are huge for teams larger than 2 members.</p>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Communication</h1>
            <p>Great tools exist, from GitHub itself to Slack to Basecamp.</p>
            <div class="learn">
              <p class="good">If you can find others who are exploring the same topics it's invaluable to setup a chat tool like Slack to share learnings and questions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="learn_and_compete">
              <p class="bad">Be sure to manage the amount of "noise" from any communication tools.  You still need the ability to think deeply and concentrate.  Going DND for an hour is okay, just tell your team members you're doing it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="compete">
              <p class="good">A proper tool to manage your collaboration through tickets is critical to keep straight who's doing what, what's outstanding, etc.</p>

          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Hosting</h1>
            <p>How do you put it "live".</p>
            <div class="learn">
              <p class="good">There's very interesting things happening in the infrastructure and DevOps world, which would be great tech to play around with at a hackathon.</p>
              <p class="bad">Hosting your project could require a lot of time and distract you from what you're trying to focus on learning.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="learn_and_compete">
              <p class="good">If your technologies work with "full serve" hosting platfrom like Heroku it can be very quick and easy to get your project live.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="compete">
              <p class="bad">Often having your project live isn't a requirement of the hackathon and teams waste a lot of time on it.  If you don't need to do it for the requirements consider not bothering!</p>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Resources</h1>
            <p>Take advantage of what is there!</p>
            <div class="learn_and_compete">
              <p class="good">There is an entire crowd of peers and mentors available to help with problems.  You'll be more successful whether your goal is learning or winning if you can take advantage of what's in the room.</p>

            <h1>Tactics</h1>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Pace</h1>
            <p>Is it a sprint or a marathon?</p>
            <div class="learn">
              <p class="good">Don't be afraid to go down tangents. You probably won't accomplish all your goals, but sometimes the most valuable learnings are the unplanned ones.  Chase the threads.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="learn_and_compete">
              <p>Finding the right balance between moving fast, but not tripping on your own toes is one of the trickiest arts of hackathons to get right.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="compete">
              <p>Take the time to plan, but don't overplan.  Your plan is going to be wrong, things are going to change.  Create a loose plan, then get to work.</p>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Divide and Conquer</h1>
            <div class="learn">
              <p class="bad">This tends to be harder to line up where two separate interests naturally complement each other.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="compete">
              <p class="good">Learning how to break up a project into loosely coupled pieces is a critical skill for hackathons and software projeccts in general.</p>
              <p class="bad">The final integration step can cause your project to fail at the last minute.  Integrate early, and integrate often.</p>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Sleep</h1>
            Do you sacrifice valuable hours for sleep, or be the all-night gladiator of the hackathon.
            <div class="learn_and_compete">
              <p class="bad">Lack of sleep has real impact on mental performance.  You might not realize it, but you *will* be creating more bugs, solving things in less efficient ways, and making more mistakes in general.  These costs are real.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="compete">
              <p class="good">This is a very short hackathon, so the extra hours *could* have some real impact.</p>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Judging</h1>
            <p>How can you optimize to win if you don't know how you're judged?</p>
            <div class="learn">
              <p>Doesn't apply here</p>
            </div>
            <div class="compete">
              <p class="good">Once you understand how you'll be judged, optimize for it.  If it's a live presentation make sure your interface is clear and simple to communicate your idea quickly.</p>
              <p class="bad">Too many developers want to believe that hackathons are won by writing the most hardcore code you can in a short time.  That's fine, but then you should accept you're not competing to win.</p>
